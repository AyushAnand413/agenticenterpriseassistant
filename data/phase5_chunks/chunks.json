    "text": "[Image Description]: the logo of the national bank\n“I am pleased to present the Annual Report for Sulabh Engineers and Services Limited for the financial year 2024-25. This year has been marked by significant progress underpinned by our commitment to financial inclusion and innovation. Despite the challenges, Sulabh has demonstrated growth. Our diversified portfolio, strategic partnerships, and prudent risk management have enabled us to expand our reach and impact. We have successfully grown our book size and enhanced shareholder’s\nvalue\nAbout Global Economy: A Perspective from the NBFC Sector\nThe global economic landscape continues to face a series of challenges—from rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical tensions to supply chain disruptions and shifting trade dynamics. Despite this, the NBFC sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience, adapting quickly to changing environments and evolving expectations.\nIn recent years, NBFCs have become critical players in the financial ecosystem, especially in emerging markets like India. Amid global headwinds, they have shown strength through diversification of lending portfolios, digital transformation, and stronger credit assessment practices. As traditional banking institutions faced limitations in reaching underserved or unbanked populations, NBFCs stepped in with innovative, tech-enabled financial products, helping maintain credit flow even during periods of economic uncertainty.\nPost-pandemic, NBFCs experienced both setbacks and recovery. While liquidity constraints, asset quality deterioration, and increased regulatory scrutiny tested their stability, the sector rebounded through restructuring measures, focused lending, and use of data analytics. Globally, NBFCs have started to re-establish investor confidence, evident through stable credit ratings, increased disbursement volumes, and improved collection efficiencies.\nIn India, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) calibrated regulatory tightening under the scale-based regulation framework has aimed to bring NBFCs closer to the regulatory standards of banks. This has not only enhanced systemic stability but also positioned NBFCs for sustainable growth in a globally integrated economy. Companies in this sector are now focusing more on risk management, transparency, and governance, in tune with international benchmarks.\nAs the global economy gradually stabilizes, NBFCs are expected to play a vital role in financing small businesses, expanding access to credit in rural and semi-urban regions, and supporting inclusive economic growth. With their agility, customer-centric approach, and increasing digitization, NBFCs are not just surviving global economic turbulence—they are moving forward with renewed strength and strategic clarity.\nIn essence, the story of the NBFC sector is one of resilience in motion—an evolving sector that continues to adapt, innovate, and lead amid a shifting global economic order.\n[Image Description]: the logo for the company\nFinancial year 2024-25 was a great year for the company. As an NBFC that plays a vital role in India's financial system, our company serves as a crucial link in the broader financial network, catering to a wide market. It is well-established that NBFCs have become key lenders to both businesses and individuals. In lending, NBFCs are generally seen as complementary to banks, often providing a better range of products and services to their customers. By all measures, our company's performance during the year under review has been outstanding. In this reporting year, the company recorded a net profit of Rs. 164.09 Lakhs on standalone basis and 325.91 Lakhs on consolidated basis.\nSulabh has been able to complete its successful, productive and innovation filled years because of our stakeholders and for many more decades to come, I appeal to all my colleagues and all our stakeholders to continue their love, trust, kindness & friendship and let us all stay together to achieve new heights.\nI extend my heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated team, our esteemed Board of Directors, and our shareholders for their continued trust and support. I am very much thankful to all our clients, who believe in us. All our stakeholders, partners and patrons on this journey have been very kind and helpful in extending their support. Together, we will continue to embrace new opportunities and achieve great success. Our dreams to fulfill other’s dream and support many to start their dreams will become true one day.”\nRegards\nS/d-",

    "title": "India: Leading the Way – NBFC Sector Perspective for FY 2024–25",
    "text": "As the global economy seeks direction amid uncertainty, India has emerged as a beacon of growth and stability, and the Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) sector is playing a pivotal role in this journey. In FY 2024–25, the NBFC industry in India continues to demonstrate strong momentum, reinforcing the country’s leadership position in driving financial inclusion, supporting MSMEs, and enabling credit access across diverse segments of the population.\nNBFCs have steadily expanded their footprint across urban and rural landscapes, helping bridge the credit gap where traditional banks have limited reach. In FY 2024–25, this role has deepened further. With the economy projected to grow at over 7%, NBFCs are aligning their strategies with national priorities—focusing on micro-lending, vehicle finance, housing loans, education financing, and small-ticket business loans. This has not only spurred entrepreneurship and consumption but also ensured more inclusive economic growth.\nTechnology has become a game-changer for the sector. Most NBFCs have embraced digital lending models, automated loan processing systems, and AI-based credit assessment tools to improve reach and reduce turnaround times. FY 2024–25 marks a significant increase in digital disbursements and collections, especially in Tier II and Tier III cities, helping NBFCs scale efficiently while maintaining portfolio quality.\nRegulatory clarity and confidence-building measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), especially the continued implementation of the Scale-Based Regulation (SBR) framework, have improved governance, risk oversight, and transparency across the sector. Larger NBFCs are now better capitalized, with improved asset-liability management practices and greater emphasis on customer protection.\nDespite rising interest rates and inflationary challenges globally, Indian NBFCs have remained resilient, aided by a growing domestic demand base, improved borrower sentiment,\n11\n[Image Description]: the logo for the company\nand access to diversified funding sources. Credit growth in the NBFC sector for FY 2024–25 is expected to exceed 12–14%, driven by retail lending and robust recovery performance.\nIn conclusion, India is indeed leading the way—and NBFCs are at the heart of this transformation. With their adaptability, digital-first approach, and deep grassroots reach, NBFCs are not just financial institutions; they are agents of progress in India's growth story for FY 2024–25 and beyond.",

    "text": "[Image Description]: the logo for the company\nDuring the current financial year as per standalone financials, the Company has demonstrated notable improvement in its financial performance, marked by steady growth across all key indicators. The Total Revenue from Operations rose to ₹165.32 lakh, reflecting a healthy increase from ₹141.69 lakh in the previous year. This growth is indicative of enhanced business activity, improved market outreach, and sustained customer engagement. The Profit Before Interest and Depreciation (PBIDTA) also witnessed a significant rise, reaching ₹219.30 lakh as compared to ₹159.46 lakh in the previous year, underscoring better operational efficiency and cost management. Furthermore, the Company’s Profit After Tax (PAT) has grown remarkably, standing at ₹164.09 lakh, up from ₹105.69 lakh in the prior year. This improvement in net profitability highlights the Company’s continued focus on financial discipline, prudent decision-making, and value creation for stakeholders. Overall, these figures reflect the Company’s strong and stable financial footing, and its commitment to sustained growth.\nAs per the consolidated financials, the Company witnessed significant growth in its financial performance across key metrics. The Total Revenue from Operations saw a robust increase, rising to ₹492.95 lakh as compared to ₹315.50 lakh in the previous year, reflecting improved operational efficiency and market performance. The Profit before Interest and Depreciation (PBIDTA) also registered a substantial jump, reaching ₹421.15 lakh in the current year, up from ₹249.69 lakh last year. This increase is indicative of better cost management and higher margins on revenue. Moreover, the Profit After Tax (PAT) surged to ₹325.19 lakh, marking a strong growth from ₹174.82 lakh in the preceding year. This rise in profitability showcases the Company’s ability to sustain earnings growth while optimizing operational costs, ultimately resulting in enhanced value creation for stakeholders.\n12\n[Image Description]: a white background with the words, ' the best way to get money from managing debt '\nRisk and Concerns\nThe Company faces a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, market risk, and operational risk. In previous financial years, the Company experienced losses primarily due to loans that were classified as sub-standard assets and, due to non-repayment, were reclassified as non-performing assets (NPAs). This significantly impacted the Company's performance. However, in the current financial year, the Company has successfully rebounded and achieved profitability.\nTo manage these risks, the Company has implemented a robust risk management framework. This framework is designed to identify, assess, and address business risks and opportunities effectively. The Company understands the importance of managing these risks to protect shareholder and stakeholder interests, achieve business objectives, and foster sustainable growth. The risk management process involves the prompt identification of risks and the development of action plans to mitigate them. These plans are continuously monitored to ensure that risks are managed appropriately.\nA strong governance framework supports this risk management approach. The Board of Directors and its committees are responsible for approving risk strategies and delegating credit authorities. The Company employs rigorous underwriting practices and ongoing risk monitoring to maintain portfolios within acceptable risk levels. Effective risk management involves proactive measures rather than reactive responses, aiming to influence future business events and minimize the likelihood and impact of potential risks.\nIn the broader context of the financial sector, the execution of risk management techniques is crucial for ensuring that business models remain viable and compliant with evolving regulatory requirements. The growth of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) has been a significant aspect of the banking sector's evolution. NBFCs play a critical role in distributing financial services, particularly in underserved areas. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Ministry of Finance has introduced various initiatives to support borrowers and institutions during challenging times. Nonetheless, it remains the responsibility of each institution to proactively address and mitigate anticipated risks to ensure continued stability and success in their operations.\n13",

    "text": "The Company’s management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company’s annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors’ report.\n76\nOur opinion on the Ind AS Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nWhen we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant laws and regulations.\nManagement’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial Statements The Company’s management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the Ind AS Standalone Financial Statements, management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nThe Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting\n77\nfrom error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management and Board of Directors.\nConclude on the appropriateness of management’s and Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of standalone financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n1) As required by the Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, 2020 (“the Order”) issued by the Central Government of India in terms of section 143(11) of the Act, we give in the “Annexure A” a statement on the matters specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order, to the extent applicable.\n2) As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, we report that:\na) We have sought and obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of our audit.\nb) In our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the Company so far as it appears from our examination of those books.\n78\nc) The standalone balance sheet, the standalone statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), the standalone statement of changes in equity and the standalone statement of cash flows dealt with by this Report are in agreement with the books of account.\nd) In our opinion, the aforesaid Standalone Financial Statements comply with the Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act.\ne) On the basis of the written representations received from the directors as on 31 March 2025, taken on record by the Board of Directors, none of the directors is disqualified as on 31 March 2025 from being appointed as a director in terms of section 164(2) of the Act.\nf) With respect to the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements of the Company and the operating effectiveness of such controls, refer to our separate Report in “Annexure B”.\ng) In our opinion and according to the information and explanations given to us, the remuneration paid by the Company to its directors during the current year is in accordance with the provisions of section 197 of the Act.\nh) With respect to the other matters to be included in the Auditors’ Report in accordance with Rule 11 of the Companies (Audit and Auditor’s) Rules, 2014, in our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us:\ni) The Company does not have any pending litigations which would impact its financial position.\nii) The Company did not have any long-term contracts including derivative contracts for which there were any material foreseeable losses.\niii) There were no amounts which were required to be transferred to the Investor Education and Protection Fund by the Company.\niv) (a) The Management has represented that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, no funds have been advanced or loaned or invested (either from borrowed funds or share premium or any other sources or kind of funds) by the Company to or in any other persons or entities, including foreign entities (“Intermediaries”), with the understanding, whether recorded in writing or otherwise, that the Intermediary shall, directly or indirectly lend or invest in other persons or entities identified in any manner whatsoever (“Ultimate Beneficiaries”) by or on behalf of the Company or provide any guarantee, security or the like on behalf of the Ultimate Beneficiaries.\n(b) The Management has represented that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, as disclosed in note 4.11 to the accounts, no funds have been received by the Company from any persons or entities, including foreign entities (“Funding Parties”), with the understanding, whether recorded in writing or otherwise, that the Company shall directly or indirectly, lend or invest in other persons or entities identified in any manner whatsoever (“Ultimate Beneficiaries”) by or on behalf of the Funding Parties or provide any guarantee, security or the like on behalf of the Ultimate Beneficiaries.\n(c ) Based on the audit procedures performed that have been considered reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, nothing has come to our notice that has caused us to believe that the representations under sub-clause (i) and (ii) of Rule 11(e) contain any material mis-statement.\nv) No dividend is declared by the company during the year\nvi) Based on our examination which included test checks, the Company has used accounting software for maintaining its books of account which has a feature of recording audit trail (edit log) facility and the same has operated throughout the year for all relevant transactions recorded in the software. Further, during the course of our audit we did not come across any\n79\ninstance of audit trail feature being tampered with and the audit trail has been preserved by the company as per the statutory requirements for record retention.",

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\nAuditors’ Responsibility\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements were established and maintained and whether such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding of such internal financial controls, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n86\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements.\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Standalone Financial Statements A company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements.",

For stage 1 an ECL allowance is calculated based on a 12 month Point in Time (PIT) probability weighted probability of default (PD). For stage 2 and 3 assets a life time ECL is calculated based on a lifetime PD.\nThe Company has calculated ECL using three main components: a probability of default (PD), a loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD) along with an adjustment considering forward macro economic conditions.\nFinancial instruments other than loans were subjected to simplified ECL approach under Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' and accordingly were not subject to sensitivity of future economic conditions.\nThe table below summarises the approach adopted by the Company for various components of ECL viz.

The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company’s reputation. The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are gross and undiscounted, and include estimated interest payments and exclude the impact of netting agreements.\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or furure cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate because of change in market interest rates.\nThe table below summarises the maturity profile of the undiscounted cashflow of the Company’s financial liabilities:\nMaturities of Financial Liabilities\nAs at 31 March 2025\nTotal\n181.20\n181.20\nAs at 31 March 2024\nTotal\n129.39\n129.39\n102\n[Table Information]: The table contains the following information: The Company’s Debt Equity ratio is as below: Particulars As at 31 March 2025 2024 Total Debt - - Total Equity 2,874.37 2,710.28 Debt / Equity Ratio - -.\n[Table Information]: The table contains the following information: Asset Classification as per RBI Norms Asset Classification as per Ind AS 109 Gross Loss Net Provisions carrying Allowances carrying required as amount (provisions) amount per IRACP as per Ind as required norms AS 109 under Ind AS 109 1 2 3 4 5 (3-4) 6 Performing assets - Loans Standard Stage- 1 1,452.64 4.15 1,448.49 2.91 Stage- 2 - - - - Sub-Total 1,452.64 4.15 1,448.49 2.91 Non-performing assets - NPA Sub-standard Stage- 3 - - - - Doubtful - upto 1 year Stage- 3 - - - - 1 to 3 years Stage- 3 - - - - More than 3 years Stage- 3 - - - - Sub-Total for doubtful - - - - Loss Stage- 3 - - - - Sub-Total for NPA - - - - Others Stage- 1 - - - - Stage- 2 - - - - Stage- 3 - - - - Sub-Total - - - - Total Stage- 1 1,452.64 4.15 1,448.49 2.91 Stage- 2 - - - - Stage- 3 - - - - Total 1,452.64 4.15 1,448.49 2.91 Difference between Ind AS 109 provisions and IRACP norms 7 = (4-6) 1.25 - 1.25 - - - - - - - - - - - 1.25 - - 1.25.\nNotes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March, 2025\n4.8 Capital Management\nThe Company’s objective for capital management is to maximize shareholder wealth, safeguard business continuity and support the growth of the Company.

Management applies judgement in categorising financial instruments using the fair value hierarchy. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement. The significance of a valuation input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThis section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the financial statements. To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard.\nLevel 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, and equity securities) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.\nLevel 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.\nLevel 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.",

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\nThe Company uses accrual basis of accounting except in case of significant uncertainties.\n1.2.1 Presentation of financial statements\nThe Company presents its Balance Sheet in order of liquidity.\nThe Company generally reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a gross basis in the Balance Sheet. They are offset and reported net only when Ind AS specifically permits the same or it has an unconditional legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts without being contingent on a future event. Similarly, the Company offsets incomes and expenses and reports the same on a net basis when permitted by Ind AS specifically unless they are material in nature.\nodoasv\nCritical accounting estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the Company's financial statements requires Management to make use of estimates and judgments. In view of the inherent uncertainties and a level of subjectivity involved in measurement of items, it is possible that the outcomes in the subsequent financial years could differ from those on which the Management's estimates are based.\nAccounting estimates and judgments are used in various line items in the financial statements for e.g.:\n• Fair value of financial instruments [Refer note no. 1.3.11, 4.10]\n• Effective Interest Rate (EIR) [Refer note no. 1.3.1(i)]\n• Impairment on financial assets [Refer note no. 1.3.4(i)]\n• Provisions and other contingent liabilities [Refer note no. 1.3.10 and 4.1]\n• Provision for tax expenses [Refer note no. 1.3.6(i)]\n• Residual value and useful life of property, plant and equipment [Refer note no. 1.3.7]",

In case of credit-impaired financial assets [as set out in note no. 1.3.4(i)] regarded as ‘stage 3’, the Company recognizes interest income on the amortized cost net of impairment loss of the financial asset at EIR.

Few examples of financial assets are loan receivables, investment in equity and debt instruments, trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Initial measurement\nAll financial assets are recognized initially at fair value including transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of financial assets except in the case of financial assets recorded at FVTPL where the transaction costs are charged to profit or loss.\nSubsequent measurement\nFor the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified into four categories:\na. Debt instruments at amortized cost\nb. Debt instruments at FVOCI\nc. Debt instruments at FVTPL\nd. Equity instruments designated at FVOCI\n109",

    "text": "The Company measures its financial assets at amortized cost if both the following conditions are met: • The asset is held within a business model of collecting contractual cash flows; and • Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are Sole Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. To make the SPPI assessment, the Company applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as the nature of portfolio and the period for which the interest rate is set. The Company determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective. The Company's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios. If cash flows after initial recognition are realized in a way that is different from the Company's original expectations, the Company does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated financial assets going forward. The business model of the Company for assets subsequently measured at amortized cost category is to hold and collect contractual cash flows. However, considering the economic viability of carrying the delinquent portfolios in the books of the Company, it may sell these portfolios to banks and/or asset reconstruction companies.\nAfter initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost on effective interest rate (EIR). For further details, refer note no. 3.1(i). The expected credit loss (ECL) calculation for debt instruments at amortized cost is explained in subsequent notes in this section.",

All fair value changes of the equity instruments, excluding dividends, are recognized in OCI and not availablefor reclassification to profit or loss, even on sale of investments. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subjectto an impairment assessment.\nDerecognition of Financial Assets\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset) when:\n• The right to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or\n• The Company has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation topay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under an assignment arrangementand the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset. Once the asset isderecognized, the Company does not have any continuing involvement in the same.\nThe Company transfers its financial assets through the partial assignment route and accordingly derecognizes the transferred portion as it neither has any continuing involvement in the same nor does it retain any control. If the Company retains the right to service the financial asset for a fee, it recognizes either a servicing asset or a servicing liability for that servicing contract. A service liability in respect of a service is recognized at fair value if the fee to be received is not expected to compensate the Company adequately for performing the service. If the fees to be received is expected to be more than adequate compensation for the servicing, a service asset is recognized for the servicing right at an amount determined on the basis of an allocation of the carrying amount of the larger financial asset.\nOn de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between:\n• the carrying amount (measured at the date of de-recognition) and\n• the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) is recognized in\nprofit or loss.\nImpairment of financial assets\nECL are recognized for financial assets held under amortized cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, and certain loan commitments.\n111\nFinancial assets where no significant increase in credit risk has been observed are considered to be in ‘stage 1’ and for which a 12-month ECL is recognized. Financial assets that are considered to have significant increase in credit risk are considered to be in ‘stage 2’ and those which are in default or for which there is objective evidence of impairment are considered to be in ‘stage 3’. Lifetime ECL is recognized for stage 2 and stage 3 financial assets. At initial recognition, allowance (or provision in the case of loan commitments) is required for ECL towards default events that are possible in the next 12 months, or less, where the remaining life is less than 12 months. In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, allowance (or provision) is required for ECL towards all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).

Based on other indications such as borrower's frequently delaying payments beyond due\ndates though not 30 days past due are included in stage 2 for mortgage loans.\nThe measurement of risk of defaults under stage 2 is computed on homogenous portfolios, generally by nature of loans, tenors, underlying collateral, geographies and borrower profiles. The default risk is assessed using PD (probability of default) derived from past behavioral trends of default across the identified homogenous portfolios. These past trends factor in the past customer behavioral trends, credit transition probabilities and macroeconomic conditions.\nThe assessed PDs are then aligned considering future economic conditions that are determined to have a\nbearing on ECL.\n112\n[Table Information]: The table contains the following information: (d) Measurement of ECL.\n[Table Information]: The table contains the following information: (iii) Offsetting of financial instruments.\n(c ) Without significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition (stage 1) ECL resulting from default events that are possible in the next 12 months are recognized for financial instruments in stage 1. The Company has ascertained default possibilities on past behavioral trends witnessed for each homogenous portfolio using application/behavioral score cards and other performance indicators, determined statistically.\n(d) Measurement of ECL\nThe assessment of credit risk and estimation of ECL are unbiased and probability weighted. It incorporates all information that is relevant including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable forecasts of future events and economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL takes into account the time value of money. Forward looking economic scenarios determined with reference to external forecasts of economic parameters that have demonstrated a linkage to the performance of our portfolios over a period of time have been applied to determine impact of macroeconomic factors. The Company has calculated ECL using three main components: a probability of default (PD), a loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). ECL is calculated by multiplying the PD, LGD and EAD and adjusted for time value of money using a rate which is a reasonable approximation of EIR.\n• Determination of PD is covered above for each stages of ECL.\n• EAD represents the expected balance at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the Balance Sheet date to the date of default together with any expected drawdown ofcommitted facilities.\n• LGD represents expected losses on the EAD given the event of default, taking into account, among other attributes, the mitigating effect of collateral value at the time it is expected to be realized and the time value of money.\nA more detailed description of the methodology used for ECL is covered in the ‘credit risk’ section of note no.\n4.7.",

    "text": "Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated financial statements.\n117\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company and its subsidiary company which is company incorporated in India has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management and Board of Directors.\nConclude on the appropriateness of management’s and Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of Consolidated financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\nObtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the business activities within the Group and its associates to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the audit of the financial statements of business activities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the business activities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by the other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we\n118\ndetermine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",

The Company has exposure to Credit, Liquidity and Market risks arising from financial instruments: a. Market Risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flow of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in the market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Company do not have any exposure to foreign exchange rate and equity price risk. b. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising out of a customer or counterparty failing to meet their repayment obligations to the Company. It has a diversified lending model and focuses on six broad categories viz: (i) consumer lending, (ii) SME lending, (iii) rural lending, (iv) mortgages, (v) loan against securities, and (vi) commercial lending. The Company assesses the credit quality of all financial instruments that are subject to credit risk. Classification of financial assets under various stages The Company classifies its financial assets in three stages having the following characteristics: Stage 1: unimpaired and without significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition on which a 12 month allowance for ECLis recognised; Stage 2: a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition on which a lifetime ECLis recognised; Stage 3: objective evidence of impairment, and are therefore considered to be in default or otherwise credit impairedon which a lifetime ECLis recognised Unless identified atan earlier stage, all financial assets are deemed to have suffered a significant increase in credit risk when they are 30 days past due (DPD) and are accordingly transferred from stage 1 to stage 2. Forstage 1 an ECLallowance is calculated based on a 12 month Point in Time (PIT) probability weighted probability of default (PD). For stage 2 and 3 assets a life time ECLis calculated based on a lifetime PD. The Company has calculated ECL using three main components: a probability of default (PD), a loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD) along with an adjustment considering forward macro economic conditions. Financial instruments other than loans were subjected to simplified ECL approach under Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments' and accordingly were not subject to sensitivity of future economic conditions. The table below summarises the approach adopted by the Company for various components of ECL viz. PD, EAD and LGD across product lines using emperical data where relevant: c. Liquidity and interest rate Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as faras possible, that it will have sufficient liquidityto meetits liabilities when theyare due, under! both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses orrisking damage to the Companys reputation. The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are gross and undiscounted, and include estimated interest payments and exclude the impact of netting agreements. Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or furure cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate because of change in marketinterest rates. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the undiscounted cashflow of the Company’s financial liabilities: Maturities of Financial Liabilities As at 31 March 2025 Due from Due from 1 to Due from 2 After 5 years Total less than 1 2 Years to 5 Years Particulars year Trade Payables 188.31 - 188.31.\n[Table Information]: The table contains the following information: As at 31 March 2025 Due from Due from 1 to Due from 2 After 5 years Total less than 1 2 Years to 5 Years Particulars year Trade Payables 188.31 - - - 188.31 Total 188.31 - - - 188.31 As at 31 March 2024 Due from Due from 1 to Due from 2 After 5 years Total less than 1 2 Years to 5 Years Particulars year Trade Payables 132.71 - - - 132.71 Total - - - - 132.71.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March, 2025\n4.7 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s Risk Management framework.\nThe Company actively manages its capital base to cover risks inherent to its business and meet the capital adequacy requirement of RBI.

Valuation methodologies adopted\nFair values of financial assets, other than those which are subsequently measured at amortised cost, have been arrived at as under:\nFair values of investments held for trading under FVTPL have been determined under level 1 (refer note no. 48) using quoted market prices of the underlying instruments;\nFair values of strategic investments in equity instruments designated under FVOCI have been measured under level 3 (refer note no. 48) at fair value based on a discounted cash flow model.\nFair values of other investments under FVOCI have been determined under level 1 using quoted market prices of the underlying instruments;\nFair value of loans held under a business model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and partially selling the loans through partial assignment to willing buyers and which contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest are measured at FVOCI. The fair value of these loans have been determined under level 3.\nThe Company has determined that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, bank balances, trade receivables, short term loans, floating rate loans, investments in equity instruments designated at FVOCI, trade payables, short term debts, borrowings, bank overdrafts and other current liabilities are a reasonable approximation of their fair value and hence their carrying value are deemed to be fair value.\n142\n[Table Information]: The table contains the following information: Fair value measurement using Particulars Carrying Quoted prices Significant Significant Value in active observable unobservable markets inputs inputs (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Financial assets Investments 632.33 632.33 - - 632.33 632.33 - -.\n[Table Information]: The table contains the following information: Fair value measurement using Particulars Carrying Quoted prices Significant Significant Value in active observable unobservable markets inputs inputs (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Financial assets Investments 855.46 855.46 - 855.46 855.46 - -.\nb. Fair values hierarchy\nFair value measurements are analysed by level in the fair value hierarchy as follows: (i) level one are measurements at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (ii) level two measurements are valuations techniques with all material inputs observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and (iii) level three measurements are valuations not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). Management applies judgement in categorising financial instruments using the fair value hierarchy. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement. The significance of a valuation input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThis section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the financial statements. To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard.\nLevel 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, and equity securities) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.\nLevel 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.\nLevel 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March, 2025",

The Group is engaged in the business of lending and agricultural activities. 1.2 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) as prescribed in the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended from time to time and notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) The group combines the financial statementsof the Company and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies have been applied uniformly across the group for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. The excess of cost to the Company of its investment in the subsidiaries over the Company’s portion of equity of the subsidiaries or vice versa is recognized in the consolidated financial statements as goodwill or capital reserve as the case may be. The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of the Company, i.e., year ended as on March 31. The excess of cost to the Company of its investment in the subsidiaries over the Company’s portion of equity of the subsidiaries or vice versa is recognized in the consolidated financial statements as goodwill or capital reserve as the case may be. Non-controlling interests (if any), in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, consolidated balance sheet, and consolidated statement of changes in equity respectively. 1.2.1 Presentation of financial statements The Company presents its Balance Sheet in order of liquidity. The Company generally reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a gross basis in the Balance Sheet. They are offset and reported net only when Ind AS specifically permits the same or it has an unconditional legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts without being contingent on a future event. Similarly, the Company offsets incomes and expenses and reports the same on a net basis when permitted by Ind AS specifically unless they are material in nature. Critical accounting estimates and judgments The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires Management to make use of estimates and judgments. In view of the inherent uncertainties and a level of subjectivity involved in measurement of items, it is possible that the outcomes in the subsequent financial years could differ from those on which the Management's estimates are based. Accounting estimates and judgments are used in various line items in the financial statements for e.g.: • Fair value of financial instruments [Refer note no. 1.3.11, 4.10] • Effective Interest Rate (EIR) [Refer note no. 1.3.1(i)] • Impairment on financial assets [Refer note no. 1.3.4(i)] • Provisions and other contingent liabilities [Refer note no. 1.3.10 and 4.1] • Provision for tax expenses [Refer note no. 1.3.6(i)] • Residual value and useful life of property, plant and equipment [Refer note no. 1.3.7] 1.3 Summary of significant accounting policies This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 1.3.1 Income (i) Interest income The Company recognizes interest income using Effective Interest Rate (EIR) on all financial assets subsequently measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). EIR is calculated by considering all costs and incomes attributable to acquisition of a financial asset or assumption of a financial liability and it represents a rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments/receipts through the expected life of the financial asset/financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. The Company recognizes interest income by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount of financial assets other than credit-impaired assets. In case of credit-impaired financial assets [as set out in note no. 1.3.4(i)] regarded as 'stage 3', the Company recognizes interest income on the amortized cost net of impairment loss of the financial asset at EIR. If the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired [as outlined in note no. 1.3.4(i)], the Company reverts to calculating interest income on a gross basis. Delayed payment interest (penal interest) levied on customers for delay in repayments/non-payment of contractual cash flows is recognized on realization. (ii) Dividend income Dividend income on equity shares is recognized when the Company's right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend..\n146\n[Table Information]: The table contains the following information: (iii) Other revenue from operations (a) Fees and commission The Company recognizes service and administration charges towards rendering of additional services to its loan customers on satisfactory completion of service delivery. Fees on value added services and products are recognized on rendering of services and products to the customer. Foreclosure charges are collected from loan customers for early payment/closure of loan and are recognized on realization. (b) Net gain on fair value changes Financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), as applicable. The Company recognizes gains/losses on fair value change of financial assets measured as FVTPL and realized gains/losses on derecognition of financial asset measured at FVTPL and FVOCI. (c) Sale of services The Company, on de-recognition of financial assets where a right to service the derecognized financial assets for a fee is retained, recognizes the fair value of future service fee income over service obligations cost on net basis as service fee income in the statement of profit or loss and, correspondingly creates a service asset in Balance Sheet. Any subsequent increase in the fair value of service assets is recognized as service income and any decrease is recognized as an expense in the period in which it occurs. The embedded interest component in the service asset is recognized as interest income in line with Ind AS 109 'Financial instruments'. (d) Recoveries of financial assets written off The Company recognizes income on recoveries of financial assets written off on realization or when the right to receive the same without any uncertainties of recovery is established. (iv) Taxes Incomes are recognized net of the Goods and Services Tax/Service Tax, wherever applicable. 1.3.2 Expenditures (i) Finance costs Borrowing costs on financial liabilities are recognized using the EIR [refer note no. 3.1(i)]. (ii) Fees and commission expenses Fees and commission expenses which are not directly linked to the sourcing of financial assets, such as commission/incentive incurred on value added services and products distribution, recovery charges and fees payable for management of portfolio etc., are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss on an accrual basis. (iii) Taxes Expenses are recognized net of the Goods and Services Tax/Service Tax, except where credit for the input tax is not statutorily permitted. 1.3.3 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, other short term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 1.3.4 Financial instruments A financial instrument is defined as any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Trade receivables and payables, loan receivables, investments in securities and subsidiaries, debt securities and other borrowings, preferential and equity capital etc. are some examples of financial instruments. All the financial instruments are recognized on the date when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the financial instruments. For tradable securities, the Company recognizes the financial instruments on settlement date. (i) Financial assets Financial assets include cash, or an equity instrument of another entity, or a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity. Few examples of financial assets are loan receivables, investment in equity and debt instruments, trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Initial measurement All financial assets are recognized initially at fair value including transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of financial assets except in the case of financial assets recorded at FVTPL where the transaction costs are charged to profit or loss. Subsequent measurement For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified into four categories: a. Debt instruments at amortized cost b. Debt instruments at FVOCI c. Debt instruments at FVTPL d. Equity instruments designated at FVOCI.\n147\n[Table Information]: The table contains the following information: The Company measures its financial assets at amortized cost if both the following conditions are met: • The asset is held within a business model of collecting contractual cash flows; and • Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are Sole Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. To make the SPPI assessment, the Company applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as the nature of portfolio and the period for which the interest rate is set. The Company determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective. The Company's business model is not assessed on an instrument by instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios. If cash flows after initial recognition are realized in a way that is different from the Company's original expectations, the Company does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated financial assets going forward. The business model of the Company for assets subsequently measured at amortized cost category is to hold and collect contractual cash flows. However, considering the economic viability of carrying the delinquent portfolios in the books of the Company, it may sell these portfolios to banks and/or asset reconstruction companies. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost on effective interest rate (EIR). For further details, refer note no. 3.1(i). The expected credit loss (ECL) calculation for debt instruments at amortized cost is explained in subsequent notes in this section. (b) Debt instruments at FVOCI The Company subsequently classifies its financial assets as FVOCI, only if both of the following criteria are met: • The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets; and • Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. Debt instruments included within the FVOCI category are measured at each reporting date at fair value withsuch changes being recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). The interest income on these assets isrecognized in profit or loss. The ECL calculation for debt instruments at FVOCI is explained in subsequent notesin this section. Debt instruments such as long term investments in Government securities to meet regulatory liquid assetrequirement of the Company's deposit program and mortgage loans portfolio where the Company periodicallyresorts to partially selling the loans by way of assignment to willing buyers are classified as FVOCI. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss. (c) Debt instruments at FVTPL The Company classifies financial assets which are held for trading under FVTPL category. Held for trading assetsare recorded and measured in the Balance Sheet at fair value. Interest and dividend incomes are recorded ininterest income and dividend income, respectively according to the terms of the contract, or when the rightto receive the same has been established. Gain and losses on changes in fair value of debt instruments arerecognized on net basis through profit or loss. The Company's investments into mutual funds, Government securities (trading portfolio) and certificate ofdeposits for trading and short term cash flow management have been classified under this category. (d) Equity investments designated under FVOCI All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' are measured at fair value. The Company has strategic investments in equity for which it has elected to present subsequent changes in the fair value inother comprehensive income. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. All fair value changes of the equity instruments, excluding dividends, are recognized in OCI and not availablefor reclassification to profit or loss, even on sale of investments. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subjectto an impairment assessment..\na) Debt instruments at amortised cost\n148\nDerecognition of Financial Assets\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset) when:\n• The right to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or\n• The Company has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation topay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under an assignment arrangementand the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset. Once the asset isderecognized, the Company does not have any continuing involvement in the same. The Company transfers its financial assets through the partial assignment route and accordingly derecognizes the transferred portion as it neither has any continuing involvement in the same nor does it retain any control. If the Company retains the right to service the financial asset for a fee, it recognizes either a servicing asset or a servicing liability for that servicing contract. A service liability in respect of a service is recognized at fair value if the fee to be received is not expected to compensate the Company adequately for performing the service. If the fees to be received is expected to be more than adequate compensation for the servicing, a service asset is recognized for the servicing right at an amount determined on the basis of an allocation of the carrying amount of the larger financial asset.\nOn derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between:\n• the carrying amount (measured at the date of derecognition) and\n• the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) is recognized in profit or loss.\nImpairment of financial assets\nECL are recognized for financial assets held under amortized cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, and certain loan commitments. Financial assets where no significant increase in credit risk has been observed are considered to be in 'stage 1' and for which a 12 month ECL is recognized. Financial assets that are considered to have significant increase in credit risk are considered to be in 'stage 2' and those which are in default or for which there is an objective evidence of impairment are considered to be in 'stage 3'. Lifetime ECL is recognized for stage 2 and stage 3 financial assets.\nAt initial recognition, allowance (or provision in the case of loan commitments) is required for ECL towards default events that are possible in the next 12 months, or less, where the remaining life is less than 12 months.\nIn the event of a significant increase in credit risk, allowance (or provision) is required for ECL towards all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument ('lifetime ECL').\nFinancial assets (and the related impairment loss allowances) are written off in full, when there is no realistic prospect of recovery.\nTreatment of the different stages of financial assets and the methodology of determination of ECL\n(a) Credit impaired (stage 3)\nThe Company recognizes a financial asset to be credit impaired and in stage 3 by considering relevantobjective evidence, primarily\nwhether:\n• Contractual payments of either principal or interest are past due for more than 90 days;\n• The loan is otherwise considered to be in default.\nRestructured loans, where repayment terms are renegotiated as compared to the original contracted termsdue to significant credit distress of the borrower, are classified as credit impaired. Such loans continue to be instage 3 until they exhibit regular payment of renegotiated principal and interest over a minimum observationperiod, typically 12 months- post renegotiation, and there are no other indicators of impairment. Havingsatisfied the conditions of timely payment over the observation period these loans could be transferred tostage 1 or 2 and a fresh assessment of the risk of default be done for such loans.\nInterest income is recognized by applying the EIR to the net amortized cost amount i.e. gross carrying amountless ECL allowance.\n(b) Significant increase in credit risk (stage 2)\nAn assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition is performed at each reporting period by considering the change in the risk of default of the loan exposure. However, unless identified at an earlier stage, 30 days past due is considered as an indication of financial assets to have suffered a significant increase in credit risk. Based on other indications such as borrower's frequently delaying payments beyond due dates though not 30 days past due are included in stage 2 for mortgage loans. The measurement of risk of defaults under stage 2 is computed on homogenous portfolios, generally by nature of loans, tenors, underlying collateral, geographies and borrower profiles. The default risk is assessed using PD (probability of default) derived from past behavioral trends of default across the identified homogenous portfolios. These past trends factor in the past customer behavioral trends, credit transition probabilities and macroeconomic conditions. The assessed PDs are then aligned considering future\neconomic conditions that are determined to have a bearing on ECL.\n(c) Without significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition (stage 1) ECL resulting from default events that are possible in the next 12 months are recognized for financial instruments in stage 1. The Company has ascertained default possibilities on past behavioral trends witnessed for each homogenous portfolio using application/behavioral score cards and other performance indicators, determined statistically.\n149\n[Table Information]: The table contains the following information: (d) Measurement of ECL The assessment of credit risk and estimation of ECL are unbiased and probability weighted. It incorporates all information that is relevant including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable forecasts of future events and economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL takes into account the time value of money. Forward looking economic scenarios determined with reference to external forecasts of economic parameters that have demonstrated a linkage to the performance of our portfolios over a period of time have been applied to determine impact of macroeconomic factors. The Company has calculated ECL using three main components: a probability of default (PD), a loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). ECL is calculated by multiplying the PD, LGD and EAD and adjusted for time value of money using a rate which is a reasonable approximation of EIR. • Determination of PD is covered above for each stages of ECL. • EAD represents the expected balance at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the Balance Sheet date to the date of default together with any expected drawdown ofcommitted facilities. • LGD represents expected losses on the EAD given the event of default, taking into account, among other attributes, the mitigating effect of collateral value at the time it is expected to be realized and the time value of money. A more detailed description of the methodology used for ECL is covered in the 'credit risk' section of note no. 4.7. (ii) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities include liabilities that represent a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial assetsto another entity, or a contract that may or will be settled in the entities own equity instruments. Few examples offinancial liabilities are trade payables, debt securities and other borrowings and subordinated debts. Initial measurement All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of borrowings and payables, net ofdirectly attributable transaction costs. The Company's financial liabilities include trade payables, other payables.debt securities and other borrowings. Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, all financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR [Refer note no. 1.3.1(i)]. Any gains or losses arising on derecognition of liabilities are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. De-recognition The Company derecognizes a financial liability when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired. (iii) Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet only if there is an enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts with an intention to settle on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 1.3.5 Investment in subsidiaries Investment in subsidiaries is recognized at cost and is not adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period. Cost of investment represents amount paid for acquisition of the said investment. The Company assesses at the end of each reporting period, if there are any indications that the said investment may be impaired. If so, the Company estimates the recoverable value/amount of the investment and provides for impairment, if any i.e. the deficit in the recoverable value over cost. 1.3.6 Taxes (i) Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Income Computation and Disclosure Standards (ICDS) prescribed therein. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date. Current tax relating to items recognized outside profit or loss is recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in other equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate..\n150\n[Table Information]: The table contains the following information: (ii) Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet approach on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets, if any, are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside profit or loss is recognized either in OCI or in other equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 1.3.7 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at historical cost of acquisition less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, consistent with the criteria specified in Ind AS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment'. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment Depreciation on property, plant & equipment has been provided on straight line method based on the useful life specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except where management estimate of useful life is different. Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. Assets costing Rs. 5,000/- or less have been depreciated over period of one year. 1.3.8 Intangible assets and amortization thereof Intangible assets, representing software are initially recognized at cost and subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment. The intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over a period of five years, which is the Management's estimate of its useful life. The useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in profit or loss within other income or other expenses, as applicable. 1.3.9 Impairment of non-financial assets An assessment is done at each Balance Sheet date to ascertain whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of asset is determined. If the carrying value of relevant asset is higher than the recoverable amount, the carrying value is written down accordingly. 1.3.10 Provisions and contingent liabilities The Company creates a provision when there is present obligation as a result of a past event that probably requires an outflow of resources and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. The Company also discloses present obligations for which a reliable estimate cannot be.\nmade. When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no\nprovision or disclosure is made.\n151",

    "title": "1.3.11 Fair value measurement",
    "text": "[Table Information]: The table contains the following information: The Company measures its qualifying financial instruments at fair value on each Balance Sheet date. Fair value is the price that would be received against sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place in the accessible principal market or the most advantageous accessible market as applicable. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy into Level I, Level II and Level Ill based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. For detailed information on the fair value hierarchy, refer note no. 4.10. For assets and liabilities that are fair valued in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy. 1.2.12 Biological Assets Biological assets are classified as Bearer biological assetsand Consumable biological assets. Consumable biologicalassets are those that are to be harvested as agriculturalproduce or sold as biological assets. Bearer BiologicalAssets which are held to bear agricultural produce areclassified as Bearer plants. Tea bushes, Coffee bushes, Pepper vines, Cardamom tiller and Shade trees are recognised as Bearer biological assets. These are classified as mature Bearer Plants and Immature Bearer Plants. Mature Bearer Plants are those that have attained harvestable stage. Cost incurred for new plantations and immature areas are capitalised. Cost includes cost of land preparation, new planting and maintenance till maturity. The cost of areas coming into bearing is transferred to mature plantations and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Bearer plants relating to Coffee and Tea bushes, Pepper vines and minor produces attain a harvestable stage in about 3-5 years. Bearer biological assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. Subsequent expenditure on bearer assets are added to its book value only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the.\nGroup and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n152",
